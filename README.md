# JS_Mini_Tasks :

=> Capitalize : JavaScript function that takes a string input and returns a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized.

=> Calc Textarea Chars : The mission of this JavaScript code is to track user input in a textarea element and display the number of remaining characters that the user can type before reaching the character limit.

=> Textarea Chars Counter : This code provides a simple and effective way to implement a character count limit for a text input field, and to display the number of characters remaining in real-time as the user types.

=> Hide Placeholder on Focus : This code allows temporarily removing the help text ("placeholder") in the input field when the user clicks on it, and restoring it if the user doesn't enter any text. This can be useful to improve the user experience by allowing the user to clearly see what they are entering without being obstructed by the help text.

=> Show / Hide Password : This code allows the user to show or hide the password in the input field by clicking on the "Show Password" button. This can be useful to allow the user to verify that they have entered the password correctly or to allow them to remember the password without having to retype it.
